# Gamified-Student-Progress-Tracker
This project is a gamified system for tracking student progress in individual lessons. It provides a motivational framework with achievements, levels, and quests, but no learning materials. The repository includes a Google Sheets script for automated tracking and a spreadsheet template, reducing teacher workload while keeping students engaged.
